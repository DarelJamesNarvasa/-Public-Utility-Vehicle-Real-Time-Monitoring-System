Public-Utility-Vehicle-Real-Time-Monitoring-System

This guide provides a procedure for the IoT PUV Real-Time Monitoring System project. It is designed to help users understand the hardware and software components used in developing a tracking and monitoring system. The system enables real-time tracking and monitoring of vehicle data, such as location, and passenger count, using IoT technologies. 


In this guide, users will learn how to set up the necessary hardware, configure the website, and integrate these elements to create a fully functional real-time monitoring solution.
